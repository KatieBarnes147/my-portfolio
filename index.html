    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I hold an <strong>M.S. in Computer Science & Software Engineering</strong> (2025) and a
      <strong>Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity & Cyber Investigations</strong>. My journey started in criminal justice and grew into a passion for technology, digital forensics, and secure application development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My hands-on work spans secure application development, forensic analysis, and incident response. Iâ€™ve built full-stack projects with Python, Java, React, and SQL, and worked with forensic tools like Autopsy, FTK Imager, and OSForensics.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics:</b> Incident response, malware analysis, and forensic investigations using Autopsy, FTK Imager, and OSForensics.</li>
      <li><b>Full-Stack Engineering:</b> Developing scalable applications with Python, Java, React, SQL, and secure API design.</li>
      <li><b>Cyber Defense & Research:</b> Exploring secure systems, vulnerability assessments, and modern software design practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m passionate about applying my skills to real-world challengesâ€”whether thatâ€™s building secure applications, investigating digital evidence, or supporting transparency through technology.
